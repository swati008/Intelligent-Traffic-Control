# Intelligent-Traffic-Control
B.E Final year Project

Here, the traffic density in all the four lanes is automatically detected based on an image processing algorithm using MATLAB. Based on the traffic density present and its percentage matching with the empty road, timing for the signals (green, red, yellow) is allocated to the respective roads. It saves time wasted on an empty road and allocating time based on the presence of heavy traffic on any of the road.
    We also have an emergency service as it detects the presence of an ambulance in any road and allocates green light to the respective road, irrespective of the density in other lanes
